<p class="p1">My sister-in-law Spee, my mom, and I went to London for a week in September.  (Half my suitcase was cancer accessories and medications.)  Spee had a consulting job three and a half days of the week and my mom and I explored London and hung out for the first few days.  We stayed in a nice hotel with small rooms a block from King's Cross railroad station.  It's a gentrifying neighborhood, around the train station, with lots of construction and pan-Euro restaurants and coffee places.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="/blog/images/IMG_0804.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-788 size-medium" src="/blog/images/IMG_0804.jpg" alt="IMG_0804" /></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Here are some of the rose gardens in the Inner Circle in St. Regent’s Park, which also houses Regent’s College, where I had a room for the term I went to school at University College London (fall 1986).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tuesday we went to this place:  </span><span class="s2"><a href="http://www.wildlondon.org.uk/reserves/camley-street-natural-park" target="_blank">http://www.wildlondon.org.uk/reserves/camley-street-natural-park</a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It used to be a coal yard for the railroad.  Converted starting in the 80s, it has paths, a bug-hunting area for kids, a pond, a lookout by the canal, and beehives. It's behind a big wall on the street sides.  It was tucked away in an area of big buildings and even more big buildings going up all around--even right on the canal. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><a href="/blog/images/IMG_0816.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-790 size-medium" src="/blog/images/IMG_0816.jpg" alt="IMG_0816" /></a> <a href="/blog/images/IMG_0810.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-789 size-medium" src="/blog/images/IMG_0810.jpg" alt="IMG_0810" /></a></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Us at the edge of the duckweed-filled Grand Union Canal.  We didn’t know it, but the nature park was just behind us.  Across the river in the picture of me is a floating temporary walkway alongside a construction site—built to replace the path along the canal during construction.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Teatime for lunch!  Ending up with a map geek-out, as don’t all meals or sit-down occasions in a foreign city?</span><a href="/blog/images/IMG_0821.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-792 size-medium" src="/blog/images/IMG_0821.jpg" alt="IMG_0821" /></a><a href="/blog/images/IMG_0818.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-791 size-medium" src="/blog/images/IMG_0818.jpg" alt="IMG_0818" /></a> <a href="/blog/images/IMG_0823.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-783 size-medium" src="/blog/images/IMG_0823.jpg" alt="IMG_0823" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">That night we went to see a play—based on the book “The Incident of the Dog in the Nighttime.”  It was weird and very good.</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="/blog/images/IMG_0844.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-785 size-medium" src="/blog/images/IMG_0844.jpg" alt="IMG_0844" /></a> <span class="s1">Wednesday we took the Tube to near the Millennium Bridge, on the north side of the Thames, and walked across it to the Tate Modern.  </span><span class="s1">Millennium Bridge featuring me.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="/blog/images/IMG_0835.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-784 size-medium" src="/blog/images/IMG_0835.jpg" alt="IMG_0835" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">The Tate Modern (the big thing with the smokestack—was a power-generation station before)</p>
<p class="p1">At the Tate we saw the <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/agnes-martin">Agnes Martin exhibition at the Tate Modern</a>.  She painted very geometric, very almost-monochromatic or duo-chromatic paintings (often actually straight graphite lines on top of paint) that are calming.  Apparently she used them to calm herself down too.  No pics because—not allowed.  I liked the small ones the best.  She painted until she died at 92.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We took the boat ferry that goes between the two Tate museums one stop beyond the other Tate to a ritzy condo/office development called St. George Wharf.  I liked the way it looked.  Oyster shells, fins, waves.  Many balconies.  Symmetrical.  That access bridge was very steep.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="/blog/images/IMG_0866.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-786 aligncenter" src="/blog/images/IMG_0866.jpg" alt="IMG_0866" /></a></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Next we had lunch at The Lamb, a venerable old pub of my mom’s acquaintance.  We had rhubarb apple cider and a light lunch and enjoyed (and sketched and video’d) the traditional pub setting.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><a href="/blog/images/IMG_0874.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-782 alignleft" src="/blog/images/IMG_0874.jpg" alt="IMG_0874" /></a> <a href="/blog/images/IMG_0870.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-787 size-medium" src="/blog/images/IMG_0870.jpg" alt="IMG_0870" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">Too bad you can't see the detail of the wood-framed glass panels above the bar to the left of the bartender's back.  Every other one is actually a window patrons can open to order another pint if the bar is crowded.  They are fancy leaded glass with patterns.</p>
<p class="p1">Around the other side of the U-shaped bar is another seating area with Hogarth prints up on the wall above it.  Then in the back is the TV room (rugby on).  And all this just a few blocks from Russell Square and the British Museum.</p>
<p class="p1">After this we went to a very weird museum, <a href="http://www.dennissevershouse.co.uk/booking-and-visiting/silent-night/" target="_blank">http://www.dennissevershouse.co.uk/booking-and-visiting/silent-night/</a>.</p>
<p class="p1">And even after that I went out to dinner with Spee and her cousin and family!  Whew that was a long day. I walked a total of 6 miles which was a crazy lot for me these days.</p>
<p class="p1">And the next morning we were off on <a href="http://ekhb.harris-braun.com/blog/england-trip-london-september-24-27-part-2/">the next part of our trip</a>--a day in Essex!</p>

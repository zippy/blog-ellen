Books I've been reading because of gifting myself with the time to read for fun, and at times necessary escape (some given to me and some recommended by my friends and family).

<I>The Position</I> by Meg Wolitzer
Great escapism until one of the 6 main characters developed Hodgkin's Lymphoma on page 110.  Yeesh.

<I>The Bright Forever</I> by Lee Martin

<I>Le Divorce</I> by Diane Johnson

The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency novels by Alexander McCall Smith
Given to me by my mom.  Fun!

<I>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</I> by Mark Haddon
Autistic teenager investigates neighborhood crime...very well done.

<I>Maisie Dobbs</I> by Jacqueline Winspear
A new kind of detective novel, set in post-WWI England.  Wonderful!

<I>The Birth House</I> by Ami McKay
A novel about homebirth in Nova Scotia in the last century

<I>The Time Traveler's Wife</I> by Audrey Niffennegger
Boy, was this book great.  I ate it up.  I am suprised it was a national bestseller, though, because it is pretty complicated to follow!

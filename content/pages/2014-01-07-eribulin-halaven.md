Wikipedia says: "eribulin is a fully synthetic macrocyclic ketone analogue of the marine sponge natural product halichondrin B, the latter being a potent naturally-occurring mitotic inhibitor with a unique mechanism of action found in the *Halichondria* genus of sponges. Eribulin is a mechanistically-unique inhibitor of microtubule dynamics, binding predominantly to a small number of high affinity sites at the plus ends of existing microtubules. Eribulin exerts its anticancer effects by triggering apoptosis of cancer cells following prolonged and irreversible mitotic blockade."

Wow, my teenage neighbor and fellow <a href="http://qivc.org">QIVC</a> member <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100009646448662" target="_blank">Bella</a> shaved her head a couple of weeks ago  to raise money for cancer research and remember and honor some people in her life who have had cancer.  I just had to go watch the mass shearing in the high-school gym, where Bella and dozens of other teens bravely said goodbye to their hair when it wasn't even spring yet!

Thank you, Bella!

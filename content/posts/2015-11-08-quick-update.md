It's Sunday afternoon and guess what? I still have pneumonia.  (I have to keep reminding myself of this to explain why I am still so, so, so very tired and worn out.)  We came home late Thursday afternoon and I keep waiting to notice I'm feeling better, but I don't notice.  I am doing much less coughing, though.

I didn't have a headache at all on Wednesday or Thursday in the hospital, but we can't figure out why.  Oxygen? Antibiotics? Now that I'm home the headache is back, which is *really* getting me down.

Anyway, the plan for the next week is: rest as much as possible, take antibiotics, and eventually feel better.  Then the week after that, back to chemo.  I guess I'm just skipping the second dose of round 29.

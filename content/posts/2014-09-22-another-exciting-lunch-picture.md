<p style="text-align: center;">So this is the kind of thing I try to eat for lunch and dinner these days: spinach salad, black bean soup, sauteed squash, sauteed mushrooms, and roasted new potatoes with homemade ají (Ecuador-style hot sauce).  Glass of water not pictured.  Of course I did snack on some whole-wheat crackers earlier in the day...</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="/blog/images/IMG_20140922_1348261.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-398" title="IMG_20140922_134826" src="/blog/images/IMG_20140922_1348261.jpg" alt="IMG_20140922_134826" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Tomorrow I start a new chemo cycle (I believe it's cycle 13).</p>

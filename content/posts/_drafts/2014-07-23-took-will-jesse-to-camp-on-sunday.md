Thought you might like to see some pictures from my pretty normal current life, in which I drove the boys to their camp in Vermont, accompanied by my sister-in-law Spee.  Eric was busy playing bass in his bass teacher's band at the bass teacher's wedding!

Click on the photos to see complete & bigger versions.  Sorry, no photos of the household bass player.

1) Minutes after we got there, Jesse was playing Magic (card game) with his Magic-playing friend from last year, Ember Lights the Nest.  (At Flying Cloud, kids get a special name after their overnight solo the first time they go)

2) Moonlit Waves, aka Jesse, took a brief Magic break to show me his yurt-like housing for the 3-week session, give me a hug goodbye, and pose for this picture.  He is not that tall. I am standing in a hole.

3) Meanwhile By the Shore, aka Will, was busy setting up his spot in his tipi, but emerged for a hug and photo.  I had been there for at least 30 minutes what with health check-in, etc., but when I found him again to say goodbye he said, "You're leaving already?"  He *is *that tall.

Originally my sparse "bucket list" featured taking my family with me to the bottom of the Grand Canyon, where I had been but they had not.  Then there was spending relaxed time in France, which we did for almost two weeks last summer; and I wanted to go to England again, too (which I did last September with my mom and Spee).

Now the list looks like this:
<ul>
	<li>Finish building a <a href="http://littlefreelibrary.org/" target="_blank">Little Free Library</a> for QIVC and neighbors.  This is now 90% finished, thanks to this weekend's focused work by my mom and her friend Paul!</li>
	<li>Get the decorative railing at the top of the stairs finally finished (by our builder friend Glenn). Designed by me years ago, it was set aside so we could finally move in! and finish it later.  It is now over five years later. :)</li>
	<li>Go to Montréal on Amtrak.</li>
	<li>Teach Jesse how to shift gears.</li>
	<li>Go to Chipotle with Will! Never been there, and he really likes it.</li>
	<li>Some more time in New Orleans with my mom (who lives there) and her cast of friendly characters.</li>
	<li>See the barn swallows return to their summer haunts around our house and build their yearly nests in our eaves.</li>
</ul>
Seems doable!

<div class="comment-content"><p>Ellen, I was thinking of you recently When something reminded me of you, and thought to look you up to see what is going on with you. I found your blog, and have been reading your stories from the past months. What a journey; I&#x27;m sorry for all you&#x27;re going through, and at the same time I am in awe of your ability to write about it all so cogently.  I have learned so much from reading your thoughtful reflections.  </p><p>I still think back fondly on our years in Brooklyn so long ago and some of it is coming back in a flood of memories now, including the evening Rebecca and I met in your apartment, and many good times after that (despite your and Rebecca&#x27;s landlord on Union Street). You introduced me to, or elevated, several things still important in my life (Richard Thompson, for one). </p><p>I&#x27;m sorry that you and your family have had to go through this ordeal. It&#x27;s clear that you have a lot of love and care around you. </p><p>Rebecca and I have 2 teenage boys now and have been in LA for many years.  If you have the energy and interest I would be happy to correspond more and fill you in on our lives, but I understand if not. I just wanted you to know that Rebecca and I are thinking of you.</p></div>

<div class="comment-content"><p>You could bring a book or 3 if you like!  The other 10% was the addition of the official LFL numbered plaque and an explanatory sign on the side of the library most visible from the road.  Both now done!</p><p>&lt;img src=&quot;http://ekhb.harris-braun.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/IMG_1581-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Little Free Library with signage!&quot; /&gt;<br>Little Free Library with signage!</p></div>

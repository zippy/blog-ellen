My weak left ankle turned outward on me for real last Friday, after weeks of threatening to do so, causing an impressive tumble to the floor in the bathroom.

<img class="size-medium wp-image-1231" src="/blog/images/IMG_1953-e1463244084530.jpg" alt="broken?" /> broken?

<img class="wp-image-1230 size-medium" src="/blog/images/IMG_1952.jpg" alt="IMG_1952" /> Just wrenched and swollen?

By the next day it hurt in a bigger and more focused way, so off we went to the nearest Urgent Care place.

I will spare you all the details but after a visit to the orthopedist on Monday I now have this at the end of my leg for 6 weeks:

Makes everything harder.  I have to use the purple walker to take the weight off that foot and this coming week will rent a small wheelchair.  Sigh. How this affects our Montreal plans I am not sure yet.  Eric thinks we should just go anyway, June 3 through 6.  I don't see why we couldn't postpone the trip for a couple weeks, until I have less pain and hassle.

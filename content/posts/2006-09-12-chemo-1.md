It went well--efficient, friendly, we liked the nurse, got to sit on the quiet side of the infusion room, and everything went fine with the various drugs.  I got a headache from the Cytoxan, but it only lasted an hour or so and wasn't very bad.  Gave my allergic oncologist advice about how best to use nasal steroid spray, to which he said "thanks, doc!" All in all it was calm and almost relaxing in a way.  It is good to get started. Now I'm home and feeling tired but otherwise fine.   Ate a nice dinner provided by members of our Quaker meeting...

I am thankful for today going so well, especially the nice morning I had before we left home at 11:00.  I'm trying to balance that with releasing expectations that tomorrow will go as well--either it will, in which case I will be newly thankful, or it won't, in which case I will deal.  Trying to let go of expectations is hard work!

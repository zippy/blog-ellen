ASCO (American Society for Clinical Oncology) <a href="http://news.medlive.cn/uploadfile/20131031/13831889146.pdf" target="_blank">top 5 evidence-based recommendations for 2013</a>.  Two are very relevant for me, one less so, two not relevant.

ASCO's <a href="http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/30/14/1715.long" target="_blank">2012 top 5 list</a>.  Two might sometime apply to me, two others are about earlier stages of breast cancer.  An excerpt, from the one about when to stop chemotherapy:
<blockquote>Smith and Hillner<sup><a id="xref-ref-15-2" href="http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/30/14/1715.long#ref-15">15</a></sup> suggested the simple rule that patients must be well enough to walk  unaided into the clinic to receive chemotherapy. When                            oncology practitioners receive direct  feedback about overuse and misuse of chemotherapy in the end-of-life  setting, they quickly                            improve practice, with chemotherapy in the  last 14 days of life falling from 50% to less than 20% in one quarter.<sup><a id="xref-ref-36-2" href="http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/30/14/1715.long#ref-36">35</a></sup> Stopping anticancer treatment should always be accompanied by  appropriate palliative and supportive care and referral to                            hospice, and the best practice would be  continuation of palliative care started concurrently at the time of  diagnosis for                            “any patient with metastatic cancer and/or  high symptom burden.”</blockquote>
Interesting that so much of these latest recommendations center around breast cancer rather than other cancers.  (Lung & prostate are also mentioned often, but not much else.)  Reasons might include: so many people have it; it's so often curable; treatment options are changing fast due to new drugs and lots of trials; high consumer pressure to improve treatment side-effects & efficacy (the effect of having mostly healthy patients, as in birth); more backward than other realms of cancer care?

<div class="comment-content"><p>Howard Brody proposed the &quot;top five&quot; for every specialty three years ago, and then Chris Cassel, when she was prez of the ABIM foundation, started &quot;Choose Wisely,&quot; which is aimed (also) at patients.  Brilliant moves!  </p><p>Following the NCCN protocols should have eliminated the need for the lists, but....   science travels upstream against habit.</p></div>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Hey Ellen. That&#x27;s some brain you have. That you can process all this information is quite astounding. And brave.</p><p>There is a whole beautiful world of people holding you in heart and mind throughout the day. Count me in that circle, too.

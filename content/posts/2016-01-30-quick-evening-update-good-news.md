<p class="p1">Just heard from my new nurse that my CT scan at 1 PM showed stable bleeding--so that is excellent news, no spread of bleeding to be seen today and no need to check my neurological all the time tonight. Woo hoo!</p>
<p class="p1">Still hoping to go home sometime tomorrow to await the Ommaya surgery when the neurosurgeon decides it's time.  Discharge will depend on both the Neurology and Neurosurgery services setting me free; then the Medicine service will cut me loose as well.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Somehow &quot;stable bleeding&quot; sounds like it should be an oxymoron, but if it&#x27;s good news, that&#x27;s all that matters! I hope you got in a movie or some New Yorker reading in addition to your walk and gentle Qi Gong--not to mention a decent night&#x27;s sleep uninterrupted by constant neurological testing. I don&#x27;t think the latter is appreciated enough by hospitals...</p></div>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s good news (although, like Shelly, I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m calling &quot;stable bleeding&quot; good news). Waiting at home sounds so very preferable to waiting in the hospital.</p></div>

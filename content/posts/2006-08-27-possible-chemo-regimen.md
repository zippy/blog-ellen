Here is what my oncologist is leaning towards: 
<a href="http://www.breastcancer.org/research_chemotherapy_021706.html" target="external">taxotere/cyclophosphamide</A>

because "TC (docetaxel/cyclophosphamide, 4 cycles) has a superior disease-free survival compared to standard AC (doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide) in 1016 women with early stage breast cancer."

I like that 4 cycles.  I would be done by Thanksgiving.

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Perhaps you are wondering how this latest day stuck in the hospital went.  Here's the report!</span></p>

<a href="/blog/images/IMG_1446.jpg"><img class="wp-image-984" title="First night in the private room" src="/blog/images/IMG_1446.jpg" alt="First night in the private room" /></a> First night in the private room
<p class="p1">Yesterday's final CT scan showed the bleed beginning to resolve.  Yay! So all was set for surgery today.  I was NPO--no food or drink--from midnight on, but got permission to skip the all-night IV fluid drip because of my previous horrible hospital-acquired edema  that pretty much disabled me for 3 weeks.  Then they kinda had to let me have ice chips this morning.</p>
<p class="p1">Surgery went well around midday and now—after 10 pm—Eric and I are in my observation alcove for the night (no more private room) and are enjoying ice cream after a delicious and long-awaited Panera soup, salad, and bread-and-butter dinner.  I think I ate enough to make up for all day’s no-food order!</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We’re going for a walk around the floor soon, before Eric leaves for the night.  We walked 0.6 miles this morning before it was suddenly time to go to surgery.  I am feeling stronger in the legs every day, even in the hospital,</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">After he goes…*New Yorker* or Netflix w/ headphones until the dexamethasone I took late at 6 will let me fall asleep.  Patients in the neighboring alcoves seem to want the TVs on, even this late, so I will need the earplugs I received a few nights ago in an earlier loud alcove room down the hall.</span></p>
<p class="p1">We expect discharge tomorrow, whether early or late in the day.  Eric will be back in the morning to wait it out with me. Normally someone post-op with a brain bleed might be kept an extra day or two for Heparin and observation...but my neurosurgeon said he and my oncologist agreed they could only push me so far.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Sounds like good news so far--and definitely good food! I hope you managed to get some sleep. Hospitals are definitely not the place for that. Glad it all went well, and glad you are getting to go home!</p></div>

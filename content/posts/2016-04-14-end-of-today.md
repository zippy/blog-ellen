Today's chemo was the start of some cycle or other--9th intrathecal methotrexate maybe, and 6th carboplatin & gemcitabine?  I am not keeping track right now. In fact for the last week or so I have not only been deeply physically tired but also very ungrounded on day of the week, day of the month, the month itself.  My routine at NY Oncology Hematology keeps changing and I am just having trouble keeping up with things.  Like, is it April or is it March still?  Or possibly it's already June?  Yikes.  Hope the fog passes over soon. And noticing how dependent I have become on the iCal app on my phone.

Cerebrospinal fluid is still coming back clear--no more cancer cells circulating--so that's continued good news.

Today we were at NYOH from 1:30 to 5:00.  Whew!  Blood draw for lab work, visit with the Nurse Practitioner who works for my oncologist, IT chemo, then regular (through the port) chemo, then finally all done and out the door at 5:00.

I got right in bed because I could feel I needed REST.  Getting better at realizing that, maybe, instead of trying to power through it.

<div class="comment-content"><p>Good news about the cerebrospinal fluid. And glad to hear you&#x27;re resting when you need it: hopefully that will help keep you from getting more tired overall. What you are going through is so utterly exhausting...and yet it must be hard to choose doing nothing (aka resting) over all the things you want to do. Resting instead of trying to power through it: that&#x27;s yet another sign of your strength. Let your apps do some of that hard lifting!</p></div>

I'm reading a very thought-provoking book about what we can do with nutrition and lifestyle changes to help our bodies be less hospitable to cancer cells. It's called *Anticancer: A New Way of Life* and the author is David Servan-Schreiber, MD.

Here is our anticancer lunch:

<div class="comment-content"><p>I think you will also love the section of the 80/10/10 book that Eric has  where the author gives lot&#x27;s of insights about fruits, sugar, cancer, and how we can have a broader view on these questions, regardless whether you want to eat raw or not.</p></div>

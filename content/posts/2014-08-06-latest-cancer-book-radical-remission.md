This book came out of a qualitative research project/dissertation by a psychologist who got interested in cancer patients with unexpectedly good outcomes--either remissions or many more  years of survival than expected.  She interviewed lots of people about what they did to enable their "radical remissions"--and despite these sometimes being called "spontaneous remissions," they don't seem to be very spontaneous.  The people with cancer made a lot of changes to get to their remissions, and she found similarities among them, culminating in nine specific areas of change that a preponderance of her interviewees worked on.

Eric read it too.  For each of the 9 strategies, there is a detailed anecdote about one person form whom that strategy was the most important change.  This is a a very patient-centered book; the interviewees are at the center of the narrative, because it's about what they did.  She also interviewed alternative & integrative healers around the world who claimed to have helped patients have "radical remissions."

It's very easy to read, though a bit frustrating for those of us who want references for **everything**.  Reading it after or paired with *Anti-Cancer* would be a good strategy if you are one of those.

So one thing most everybody did was radically change their diet to eliminate or almost-eliminate meat, dairy, refined grains, and refined sugar.  Hmmm.

More soon on my informative trip to the <a href="http://www.blockmd.com" target="_blank">Block Center</a> in Illnois.

<div class="comment-content"><p>Wow. I just watched Keith Block&#x27;s 6 minute video on the Block Center website. He&#x27;s convincing! He doesn&#x27;t try to make false promises or give false hope, but what he says makes stunning sense. So glad you went there and that you&#x27;re looking &quot;beyond the box!&quot;</p></div>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Huh - interesting.  I wonder if it applies to brain tumors as well.  I should look at it!  Glad you are finding good resources--that seems really important.</p></div>

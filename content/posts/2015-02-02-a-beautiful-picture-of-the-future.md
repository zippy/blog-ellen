I greatly enjoyed perusing this illustration from a *Scientific American* article (thanks, Paul): <a title="image from Scientific American of oncolytic viruses" href="http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v311/n5/box/scientificamerican1114-54_BX1.html" target="_self">"How Oncolytic Viruses Destroy Tumors"</a>

Ahhhhh wouldn't that be great?

Today is the day for stereotactic radiosurgery at Albany Medical Center.  I am loaded up with anti-seizure medication and steroids, and will get more steroids and Xanax before I get my head nestled into the "head hammock" (nicer than calling it the rigid-plastic-mesh face cage) for my 2+ hrs of radiation beams.  I have to lie still that whole time, but the head hammock will keep my head still for me.

The "head hammock" made of rigid plastic, attached to the table:

When it was made it was flexible while warm and they molded it onto my face:

This was a cool picture Eric took:

That was made on Friday after I had chemo Friday AM.  The chemo was easy--an IV, a 5-minute "push" of the Eribulin, some anti-nausea medication which worked well on Friday, plus for good measure, a shot in the shoulder for the bone medicine Xgeva.  

Over the weekend and on Monday I was queasy for most of the days, but it wasn't too bad.  Ginger ale was the thing that helped the most.  Next time I will ask for some Kytril (anti-nausea med) to bring home.  Friday I was just strangely hungry!  We went out for Thai food for lunch before we left Albany, after the set-up stuff we had to do with radiation oncology.  (Check the mask, take measurements, do a CT scan, do an MRI).

So chemo is over with until the 20th and now it's just the zapping ahead.  Which I have to get in the car and go toward right now!  My friend Isa said: "I love that, by about 3pm today, you'll have a shiny, well, healthy and happy brain."  I am holding that intention close!

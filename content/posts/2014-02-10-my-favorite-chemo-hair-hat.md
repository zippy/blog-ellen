(That's chemo multiplied by negative hair)

It's soft & stretchy and has a nice shape on a head missing most of the hair.  I have two!  Yay!

<div class="comment-content"><p>Elann.com is a yarn/knitting store ... so someone (you?) knitted the two versions of that soft, nicely-shaped hat, huh? Cool.</p></div>

<div class="comment-content"><p>It IS somewhat sweater-like.  Great for winter.  Yes, my light-purple one was knitted (and discovered) by my midwife friend Wendy, and then I asked someone else to make another one in teal blue (could it have been Erika?).  And I think a third one is in the works.</p></div>

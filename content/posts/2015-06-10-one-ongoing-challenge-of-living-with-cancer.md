I am getting **bored** with how much I think about/talk about/update people about what's going on with my annoyingly imperfectly-functioning body.  It just begins to sound really dull and repetitive to me...and must eventually to others as well!  I am certainly better at talking about, or just more willing to talk about, the physical goings-on than my mental or emotional or psychological goings-on, which are probably of more interest overall to others.  But when I'm with other people I really don't want my cancer life to dominate the conversation--it's so much less interesting overall than other topics!

But it's not just about my interactions with other people; I am getting a bit fed up with how much of my **own** attention my body currently requires.  I wake up feeling not so good; or I can't fall asleep because various things hurt or feel weird; I then start to investigate whether this is just tiredness from not enough sleep, post-chemo ick, post-radiation fatigue still dogging me, or did I do too much with all that going on yesterday and now I'm paying a body price?  Or is something new going on that I need to pay attention to, some new symptom or side effect that needs to be reported on, treated, prevented, ameliorated?  *Whoof!* it's kind of tiresome.  It's another way in which cancer is taking up so much of my life--not a way I anticipated.

<div class="comment-content"><p>Speaking about health challenges has a bad reputation in our culture. It does not necessarily follow that because someone is speaking about them that they are boring. People can make anything boring or anything interesting - depending on their relationship to it and their level of engagement in sharing it. So I guess your key is if YOU are bored with what you are saying or perhaps how you are saying it. </p><p>Me thinks It&#x27;s cool that you are bored. Something new is taking shape, Watch that space : )</p></div>

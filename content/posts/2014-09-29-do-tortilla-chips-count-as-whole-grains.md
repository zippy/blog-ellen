Foods I've been eating lately:
<ul>
	<li>Kale & fruit smoothies every morning: kale from our garden, 1/2 banana, 1/4 cup frozen mango, juice from half a lime, 2 oz homemade kefir, 2 oz OJ, big scoop of glutamine powder for neuropathy, 1 tsp flax-seed oil for omega 3s.  Gradually adding more & more kale.  I think I would be happy drinking almost anything if it had enough lime juice in it.</li>
	<li>Wheat berries for breakfast: soaked & cooked, with a bit of fakey butter, maybe a dribble of maple syrup (thanks Charlie P.!) and salt.</li>
	<li>Kombucha that we make at home, with fruit.  The latest batch has peaches and ginger.</li>
	<li>80% dark chocolate.  The best chocolate bar I've had in a long time is this one: <a href="http://shop.equalexchange.coop/organic-chocolate-bar-extra-dark-panama.html" target="_blank">Equal Exchange Organic Panama Extra Dark</a>.</li>
	<li>Shiitake mushrooms</li>
	<li>Sushi dinners: how cancer-fighting of me! They include these cancer-fighting foods: fatty fish (salmon), seaweed, green tea, sometimes shiitakes. A *must* for the anti-cancer lifestyle.</li>
	<li>Homemade low-sugar granola.  I have perfected my recipe for almond granola with little enough sugar & oil that it seems reasonable to eat as a main cereal (not just a sprinkle-on-top cereal).  Now my issue is: I can't die anytime soon--who will make healthy granola for my family?</li>
</ul>
P.S. Well, they do, but they're fried. Except if you make them at home and bake them instead (6 min per side @ 350).

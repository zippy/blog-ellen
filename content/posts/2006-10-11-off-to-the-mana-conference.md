Tomorrow I am going to Baltimore for the MANA conference (that's <a href="http://www.mana.org">Midwives Alliance of North America</A>).  My hats and bandannas and I will be home Monday night after going to presentations, giving a presentation, going to the Division of Research meeting Monday, and hanging out with my MANA friends throughout, which I greatly look forward to.  Perhaps there will be henna.  

Oh!  I made a first experiment in head henna with the help of my friend Arti.  Here is a picture.  The sexy hennaed forearm is Eric's.

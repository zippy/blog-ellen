This morning I woke up at 8.  It's 10 am and I have already:
<ul>
 	<li>had bad back pain and gotten Eric to rub my back before putting on the three-times-a-day pain lotion</li>
 	<li>slathered my fingers with another kind of pain lotion because they hurt in a bad-cold sort of way</li>
 	<li>thrown up out of nowhere</li>
 	<li>tripped on the walker I was leaving at the top of the stairs, had nothing to grab or break my fall with, and landed flat on the floor kind of howling</li>
 	<li>wondered, at the end of all this, why am I hanging in...</li>
</ul>
Maybe soon it will be time for breakfast?

Yesterday we went to Shivani and Jon's wedding.  This sounds simple but it wasn't, and almost all the ahead-of-time detail work that made it as simple as possible for me was thought of and executed by Eric with generosity and self-motivation.  I am lucky in my long-ago choice of partner, for sure.

The wedding was at 11 am by the side of Ooms Pond.  It was a chilly summer morning but, politely, it only rained for the actual ceremony, not the waiting time before or after.  It was a light rain and its biggest annoyance was that its noise on umbrellas made it hard to hear the vows.

I sat in a big collapsible chair borrowed from Emilie and tried to take some interesting pictures.  I got wet but not too cold and was very, very glad to be there and feeling all right (other than tired).

<div class="comment-content"><p>What a horrible and unhappy morning. I hope the enjoyment of the wedding the day before offered some bit of balance.</p></div>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Hmm, I don&#x27;t look back on that day as horrible, rough,or unhappy.  Maybe that&#x27;s why I told about it in two separate posts?  The morning and its trials was just...well, that&#x27;s how it goes for me these days but it was an overwhelmingly larger than usual number of events* strung close together.  The frustration and getting hurt is par for the course these days and boring to think and talk about, so I don&#x27;t.</p><p><br>*I am losing vocabulary so I invent these strings of words that kind of get close to the idea whose word I can no longer find in my brain.</p></div>

Coming to you live from the chemo suite! Our trip is over and we're slowly getting back into the patterns of normal life.  Which of course include chemo.

It seems like Jesse grew an inch while we were gone. They are interested in helping me out, which is fun. This afternoon they pushed my chair for a bit because Eric had to park the car instead of coming in with us. I wanted a picture.

Two days ago was Ellen's 50th birthday, a bittersweet marking on the calendar of her life.  How immensely grateful we are that she was born on that special day in 1966.

Gina baked and brought over the spectacularly delicious chocolate cake you can see in the photos.  Ellen did enjoy a bite of the cake, which is saying something as she's choosing to eat less and less.  Ellen was alert and smiled quite a bit as we serenaded her, and we read her birthday wishes she'd received, and heard her birth story from Kathryn, a tradition in our family.

Yesterday, Ellen was officially admitted into hospice care.  Many people want to come say good-bye to Ellen and we are sadly saying "no" out of respect for Ellen's clear instructions not to have visitors.  We have been flooded with offers to help in so many ways, and we thank you, even though we find we need little more than to be with Ellen on her journey.

Your love surrounds Ellen and us powerfully - thank you so much.

<div class="comment-content"><p>Love and good-byes to Ellen. One of the strongest people I have ever known, facing cancer not once but three times and maintaining grace, good cheer, and even optimism amidst all the fear and uncertainty. As corny as it sounds, I feel honored to have counted her among my friends. I have no more words.</p></div>

Last Thursday I tried to get a second-opinion appointment at Dana-Farber with the breast oncologist most recommended by Dr. C., my oncologist, and was told she didn't take walk-ins, only special requests by other oncologists.  So I asked Dr. C. to contact her.  He did, she said yes by e-mail on Saturday, and I have an appointment at noon on Friday.  So I guess I'm feeling special.

I keep puzzling over what, exactly, requires my actual *presence* in this second-opinion process (Eric says I should just reread <a title="How Doctors Think" href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Doctors-Think/dp/0195187121">my mom's book</a> for the answer).  I may have questions for her, but in terms of what she needs to know about me, exactly why do I need to show up in front of her?  Nevertheless, I'm going.  We're going.

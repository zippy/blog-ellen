At our appointment with the oncologist this morning, we put our heads together and juggled the brain-zapping procedure (1/15), chemo on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle, and our planned last-minute trip to the bottom of the Grand Canyon (1/25-1/30 if it all works out).  Stir in some anxiety on everyone's part about the 8 weeks that have elapsed since the MRI that showed metastasis--8 weeks without any chemo treatment yet--and you get an audacious plan: start chemo tomorrow, brain-zap next week, continue chemo a couple days late on the 20th, go adventuring, and return for more chemo the first week of February (and the second, and fourth…repeat as long as it works).

After that plan was made, we stopped in at radiation oncology to see what was up with my set-up appointments, and they had just called to tell us to come in tomorrow.  But there we were, so we got started today with a little face-and-head-mask-making.  Pictures to come. I know you have all always wondered about the science-fiction-like details of stereotactic radiosurgery.

<div class="comment-content"><p>So glad you are getting treatment started AND that you&#x27;re going to visit the Grand Canyon. I hiked to the bottom, &amp; back up, many years ago, w/an overnight at the Phantom Ranch on the canyon floor - an awesome &amp; memorable experience. Will be very interested to hear how that adventure goes for you - in the winter, no less!</p><p>Love to you &amp; your family!</p></div>

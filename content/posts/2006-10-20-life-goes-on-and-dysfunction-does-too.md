I'm back from Baltimore and it's the middle of week 3 of my chemo cycle, so I am busily trying to DO STUFF before next Tuesday.  There are many things that need doing before the end of the month, and I'm assuming that Tuesday through Saturday or Sunday next week I won't feel much like doing them.  So, in an ironic turn of events, I'm finding myself piling on the to-dos this week, and feeling anxious about not getting them done, in an attempt to give myself a break next week (and not feel anxious about not getting things done).

Hmm.  I'm sure I should think on that some more, but I don't have time!  Gotta go.  :)

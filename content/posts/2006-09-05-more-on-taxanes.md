<a href="http://www.medpagetoday.com/HematologyOncology/2005SABCSMeeting/tb/2308">Better coverage of the one Taxotere-Cytoxan study</a>: abstracted/presented 2005, not yet published, 1016 early-stage women, all with surgery, chemo, & radiation; those taking TC x 4 had better 5-year disease-free survival rates (86%) than those taking AC x 4 (81%).  That's a significant difference overall, but for node-negative women there wasn't much of a difference.  Overall survival was about the same.  Mean follow-up was 5.5 years.

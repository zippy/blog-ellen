A few weeks ago I received a nice big plain red bandanna in the mail from a friend.  I also got a lavender one and in the package were two black bandannas with skulls and crossbones on them.  (I'm assuming those are for the boys.)

We were in the car.  I tied the red one over my head and it was big enough to even make a sort of folded headband in the front and still cover my head.  I checked myself out in the mirror and was feeling pretty dashing indeed--hey, this could work! maybe I actually look <I>good</i> this way!--until a five-year-old voice from the back seat of the car said, "Mommy, you look like you're wearing a napkin.  (pause)  From a restaurant."

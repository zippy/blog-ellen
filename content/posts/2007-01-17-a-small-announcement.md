I'm done.

With the whole slash/poison/burn series of treatments for this summer's breast cancer, at least.  Today was my last zap.
We keep getting asked "So now how do they know if it worked?" or "Test results coming back okay?" and we keep explaining that they--we--don't know.  That there are no test results.  That all of this (beyond surgery) was Just In Case.  That the jury's out for oh, the next 5 or 10 years...ask us then and we'll have an answer.

Of course, in this situation, to not know is good, because the only way to *know* is if it's come back.

<div class="comment-content"><p>Wow. When did you write this article? Where was it published?<br>It looks wonderful. I have not read it in detail yet but skimmed it. How surprising to find that this link leads to an article by you! and, your Mom, I presume? <br>Is it already on this blog under links? I don&#x27;t see it. You should put it there.<br>Thanks for the quote. I&#x27;m pulled up out of thinking momentarily that the central question is how much chocolate do we have left in the chocolate box. Sharpening up feels good. So does loving you.</p></div>

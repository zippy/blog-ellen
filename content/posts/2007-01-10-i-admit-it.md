...I am still here.  

Radiation every weekday 25 minutes away is a good excuse for not doing much else on the cancer-patient front.  But I have done <I>some</I> else: a visit to the gynecologic oncologist to talk about ovaries, follow-up with the surgeon, a date to go back to the OR to get my port removed (1/23), and lots of reading.  My lifetime risk of ovarian cancer is around 44%.  This is of a cancer that is only caught at a curable state 25% of the time.  Makes one think.

Radiation has gone smoothly--I'm in and out of there in 15 minutes almost every day--and I'm now going at 8:15 (right after the schoolbus pick-up) so as to get it over with and have my day be less broken up (10:30 was not a convenient time).  5 more treatments and I'm done with that.  I am sunburned, which is a pain, and have been very, very tired.  I am feeling a little less tired today (I carried in 4 bags of groceries instead of leaving them for Eric, and haven't had to lie down since I got up this morning).

I have hair.  Due to fatigue, lingering effects of chemo, or both, my brain is still fuzzy.  Thus I have been saying my head has fuzz inside and out.   A couple of weeks ago:

<p class="p1">Surprisingly I don't think that often about the high chance that I'm going to probably die pretty soon from this cancer. I try to think about it, but it's really hard to conceive of, even when given a life expectancy that is measured in months.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  How to believe in that? *Why* believe in that?  </span>I don't really know how it will go and it is hard to believe, I guess, even for me.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>But then I step back a little bit and catch myself stumping around the kitchen, say, after breakfast—trying to do my part to clear the table—and I walk like a penguin and I almost fall down and I am breathing hard don't have any energy.  This is *not* a healthy person.</p>
<p class="p1">So I walk to the fridge and put something away, walk back to the table, and walk back to the fridge and I'm panting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I don't have any energy and have to rest, but then I don't always rest because I'm stubborn so I end up wearing myself out like this many times a day.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>This morning after breakfast I decided to come up to bed again and sit and read so I had to get all the things I needed to do that and then come upstairs, which is hard these days.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then I remembered I would want the phone if it rang, and then I needed water, and then I needed to take a morphine, and once I did all that I was just staggering around like a drunken penguin because I just had no energy and could barely get myself to move around. So then I plopped into bed and waited a little bit before I could swing my legs in because I was so tired.</p>
<p class="p1">So I keep wearing myself out and I don't notice all the time how far I am from being a healthy person.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Then some kind of reality check sinks in, like being offered a cut in the bathroom line at the movie because I have a stick to help me balance and I am obviously not healthy.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> Oh.  This is me they're offering special treatment to?</span></p>
<p class="p1">On paper right now things look okay.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  T</span>he chemo we started in December and early February are both working, it seems like from the CAT scans and MRIs, and so on paper my cancer is ‘responding to second-line therapy” blah blah blah but then in my real life right now it seems really hard. Maybe more for emotional and psychological reasons than physical, but the physical – particularly fatigue and trouble walking – is pretty tough right now.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Yeah, you could conceive of it if you had a life expectancy of pain or discomfort or fatigue, but it doesn&#x27;t compute when it&#x27;s something you&#x27;ve never experienced. Thank you for sharing the rawness of this time with us. LOVE</p></div>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Oh Ellen, this sounds so very frustrating. The cure for this awful thing called cancer is so hard on the body, with so many tough side effects.  Wish I was there to carry some of the load.  sending much love.</p></div>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I&#x27;m happy that you&#x27;re &quot;technically&quot; doing better. Maybe your body will follow once the cancer remisses (is that a word) sufficiently? We can hope.</p></div>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Your sharing this journey is a real gift, as hard as it is for all of us to read it. You are such a strong example of the strength and resilience of the human spirit--and the human body, the way you keep pushing yourself to the edge of (and beyond?) your body&#x27;s current limits. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;d rather not be this kind of guidepost, and I just goddamn wish you didn&#x27;t have this horrible journey to share. Sending (or trying to send) strength and energy to hang in there while the treatment does its worst to the cancer cells.</p></div>

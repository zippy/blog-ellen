I can't walk well right now because of my numb and untrustworthy left foot and ankle; because I get big dizzy spells when I try to walk after sitting for 45 minutes or more; and because I get out of breath from just the effort of walking.

A few days ago I scolded myself silently, again, for being so darn stubborn, and used a motorized cart at the grocery for the first time. I don't want to be seen as someone who needs one of these at the store.  But now I am.  It was helpful and I got to do the shopping with my friend Lisa instead of either wearing myself out trying to walk the whole store or waiting in the car.  And on my maiden voyage, aka learn to drive this weird vehicle, I only ran in to one thing.

And, and, *and* I actually ordered a walker today.  I was convinced to try it once I saw a model with a built-in seat--handy for dizzy spells--and made of purple anodized aluminum.

Mobility being my biggest challenge right now, I guess I will throw tech at it.

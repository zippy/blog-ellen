Dealing with Fatigue:



Boy, do I sound tired! Possibly more tired in my voice than the rest of me.  I did notice today that my voice was really weak, so you are getting to hear what that sounds like.  Not much like me, at least to my ear.

<div class="comment-content"><p>Whew, you do sound tired.  And somehow, more like your mom as well. I&#x27;m glad to hear that you are resting plenty, but also getting outings.  Can&#x27;t wait to see you soon.  xoxo</p><p>Deb</p></div>

<div class="comment-content"><p>You do sound tired, but also like you had a good day, which I assume makes the fatigue more worthwhile? So glad you are surrounded by caring friends and family.</p></div>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I&#x27;m appreciating the voice clips. Though you sound tired, you sound like you you you AND how cool that you got to go to Chatham. I&#x27;ve always wanted to go there : ) Rest as much as you need and good luck with the up/down flow dance challenges of all sorts. Big Love, G</p></div>

<div class="comment-content"><p>I am struck by the experience of these voice clips as an intimate gift. A gift that affords us who know and love you the feeling of being with you, accompanying you in some small way and the gift of a caring companion to others who may need company on a similar journey of their own at some time in the future.</p></div>

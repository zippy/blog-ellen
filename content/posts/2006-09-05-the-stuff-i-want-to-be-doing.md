What I've done for the last few days/plan for the next few days:

Last Thursday: doula visit
Friday: birth
Saturday: family outing, then be useful to a friend because of being a "birth person"
Sunday: postpartum visit to Friday's new parents
Monday: initial meeting with potential doula clients
Tuesday: work on doula-client filing system, fill out doula forms, revise handouts
Wednesday: visit birth center with Kristin and Pat
Thursday: ? maybe revise those handouts I didn't get to!
Friday: come along on prenatal visit to Natalie's doula clients

Ahhhhhhhhhh.

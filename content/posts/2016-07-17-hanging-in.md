That's what I tell inquirers when they ask how I'm doing and I have nothing to say that is particularly interesting.

So over the past week it's been pretty much like that, except for good news from my recent MRI and CT scans: nothing known to be new; nothing bigger than last time; lots of things--and by things, we mean ***tumors***--that stayed the same size.

Maybe some other notable things happened this past week, but I just don't remember them at the moment. Chemo is weakening my memory for sure. However, at least now you know that I am still around and still hanging in. Or a reasonable Internet facsimile is.  But ouch.  Would a mere reasonable Internet facsimile have such intense back pain and complain about it this much?

<div class="comment-content"><p>A mere reasonable Internet facsimile would improve on things, or so I&#x27;d like to think. WIsh you could program that. I assume nothing new is good news, though shrinkage of existing &quot;things&quot; would be better? They have got to come up with some new and improved treatments, dammit!</p></div>

The zap on Thursday was much quicker and easier than last January, and now I'm feeling low-energy (as expected) and fuzzy in the brain (also expected, due to temporary anti-seizure meds I have to take just in case for a week).  My mom is visiting to help out and I am spending much time on the couch in front of the warm masonry heater!  Chemo starts again on Thursday. More news later.

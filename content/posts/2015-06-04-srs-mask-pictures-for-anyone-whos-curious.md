<div class="comment-content"><p>Ellen, there are few enough people blogging about their experience with metastatic cancer, let alone having pictures taking of them as they are being treated, let alone transforming it into a cartoon accompanied by your succinct ironic comments and asides.  Thanks you for your continued courage and humor which is an inspiration to so many including me.</p></div>

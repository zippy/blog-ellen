It's day 4 after chemo #2 and I am queasy and quite tired, and taking it easy (for once).  I have been napping and reading and resting.  I realized yesterday--remembering that I hadn't added to the blog since before chemo on Tuesday--that it takes a certain amount of energy to write something that is not just a list of complaints, but instead is at least a bit interesting.  

This morning I got sick of what was left of my hair (which was falling out in clumps when touched anyway) so here is a photo essay!  Click for bigger photos.
<a href="/blog/images/01.jpg"><img align="middle" src="/blog/images/01.thumbnail.jpg"></a> This morning...half of it gone already, looking pretty sorry.

<a href="/blog/images/31.jpg"><img align="middle" src="/blog/images/31.thumbnail.jpg"></a>Results after scrubbing one hemisphere of my head in the shower but not the other!

<a href="/blog/images/21.jpg"><img align="middle" src="/blog/images/21.thumbnail.jpg"></a>Then Eric shaved it all off.  Voila, the piratical look.  After that he shaved it with a razor.

<a href="/blog/images/41.jpg"><img align="middle" src="/blog/images/41.thumbnail.jpg"></a>First bandanna choice...

<a href="/blog/images/51.jpg"><img align="middle" src="/blog/images/51.thumbnail.jpg"></a>The actual head!

<div class="comment-content"><p>Not to deny the challenges of losing your hair but it must be said that you are still ravishingly beautiful! How lucky you are to have such a beautifully shaped head, great bone structure, sparkling, vivid eyes, and of course the depthful, humorous,intelligent soul that animates it all.<br>Thank you for letting those of us who care share in what&#x27;s happening, the sick and the well, the heaven and the hell, and all the worlds between..</p></div>

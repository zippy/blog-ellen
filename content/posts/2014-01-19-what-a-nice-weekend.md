I took it pretty easy Thursday and Friday, for me, and Saturday we had wonderful friends visiting overnight.  I was tired & a bit loopy from the anti-seizure medication I'm on (standard prophylactic post-procedure stuff, along with steroids), but greatly enjoyed myself.  This afternoon I took a walk and gradually edged myself into bed where I have been using my brain but resting my body ever since.  

The people who are living with metastatic cancer are showing up for me--through personal connections with some of you, thank you!, and just by the power of the web (and those of you helpfully pointing me to where I need to look).  It has been really good to be able to people the landscape in front of me with the existence of these folks, even if I don't know them, even if I don't ever call them in the end.

What next week offers: chemo tomorrow AM, a final postpartum visit with a recent client Tuesday, a follow-up appointment with the radiation oncologist Thursday, and PACKING! for the Grand Canyon emergency family adventure trip that starts Saturday AM (and brings us home Thursday the 30th).

I don't like being the center of attention.  I don't like giving people bad news.  This is not a good recipe for someone who has to go around announcing that she has breast cancer again.  Silver Bay, where there were maybe 50 people who needed to be told, was getting a bit agonizing.  

Hi, how are you? 
Oh, I've been better.  

Eric told a few people.  I told a few people.  Spee and Sandy mercifully went around telling some of our friends so I wouldn't have to...what a relief!  I felt so taken care of.

Telling parents is, of course, the worst of the worst, especially now that I am a parent myself.

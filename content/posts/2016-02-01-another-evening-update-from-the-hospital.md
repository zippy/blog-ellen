<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I am still in the hospital, but in a private room now so things are better.  Last night we--five of us--had a Thai food picnic along with cranberry-orange granita made by my friend Isa, and then Jesse and I watched our TV show together while snuggling and Eric did a bit of work in the family waiting room.</span></p>
<p class="p1">I did not get to go home, but surgery is scheduled for tomorrow. Morning, we hope.  Today I had vein studies (ultrasounds) to assess clot risk and another CT scan that the neurosurgeon will use like a GPS map tomorrow.  Other than that, it has been walking the halls, meeting new nurses, and doing a few bits of business with Eric, who arrived around 10 AM.</p>
<p class="p1">Right now we are waiting for Jens, Spee, and Jesse to arrive for dinner and hanging out. This is one of Jesse's two weekly nights at home, because they are boarding five days right now at Bard Academy. So I want to see as much of Jesse as possible even if I'm not home.</p>
<p class="p1">After an extra weekend spent at home instead of at Buxton--which ended up being spent largely here at the hospital or back-and-forth in the car--Will took one of our VW's back to school with him yesterday so he can come back and visit when he needs to.</p>
<p class="p1">Spirits are good even though I miss my bed and my sofa and my fire.  I have my people.</p>

<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi, Ellen. I knew you a while ago as a fellow young adult in NYYM. I just wanted to say hello and that I&#x27;m reading your blog and thinking about you and Eric and your kids and what you&#x27;re going through. I&#x27;m holding you all in the light (as best as I can.) Sending love and peace from Brooklyn, NY. -- Sarah Way</p></div>

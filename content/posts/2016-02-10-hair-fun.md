<p class="p1">Lisa and Aaron, who visited to help out (tremendously!) for the past few days, did the clay-dye job the other night in the bathroom with friend Anne while Jesse supervised from the bathroom shower.</p>
<p class="p1">Hmmm, I look a little tired in that last photo.  Yesterday was my fullest and most energetic day in weeks.  Shivani and I went to midwifery peer review, driven by Lisa and Aaron, who explored Saugerties.  Nowdays I pay the next day for days like that--just in fatigue.</p>
<p class="p1">Plans for the rest of the day: a visit from the palliative care nurse, and before that some craniosacral therapy with my friend Meg. Then maybe a nap or Netflix before dinner.</p>
<p class="p1">I am still working on those voice memos for the blog. Let me know if they don't work for you–hoping they are easy because they sure are easier for me.</p>
<p class="p1">Now for lots of pictures!  I am really enjoying pictures these days.</p>

After chemo last Tuesday, my awesome nurse Amy suggested we try to call in a prescription for Neulasta and see if my insurance company would cover it that way and give it to me for $50 (my highest drug co-pay).  Then my doctor in Chatham could stick me with it on Wednesday and I wouldn't have to come back to Albany for a 3-minute appointment.

The CVS down the street from Albany Med had a dose to prescribe for me...we went to pick it up...it cost $50.  List price on the receipt: $2856 or something.  We took it home and put it in the fridge, and the next afternoon Dr. Jeff in Chatham did the honors and I paid him the usual $25 co-pay.  The instructions for the Neulasta said, and I kid you not, "Remove injector from carton before injecting."  They don't mess around telling you <I>exactly</I> how to use such expensive medicine, I guess.

So: round 1 Neulasta? Over $6,000 all told.  Round 2 Neulasta? $75 total.

Health insurance is so deeply weird.

And Dr. Jeff points out that New York Oncology Hematology is criminal for charging that much for a drug.  After all, it <I>only</I> costs $2856.  How do they think they can get away with charging over twice that much?  (See previous paragraph for the answer.)

<div class="comment-content"><p>Hi, Francois!  An astute suggestion.  I think if it meant to me &quot;I am sick&quot; I would have to rush to take your advice.  One of the books I&#x27;m reading (Dancing with the Diagnosis) talks a lot about reframing the experience of dealing with cancer by watching your words and replacing them with less freighted words when you notice what you&#x27;re doing to yourself with them.  However, to me for this purpose &quot;sick&quot; and &quot;well&quot; are two places I dwell in, two levels of my life, rather than two adjectives describing me.  I can be healing in the world of the sick...I can be feeling sick in the world of the well (but not lately).</p></div>

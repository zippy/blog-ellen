On my way up and down the elevator from Nuclear Medicine the day before my first surgery, the doors kept opening on the 5th floor, where there was a big bright cheerful sign:

<B>Morrell Center for Childhood Cancer and Blood Disorders</B>

Every time, I kept thinking, <I>thank goodness this is about me and not them.</I>

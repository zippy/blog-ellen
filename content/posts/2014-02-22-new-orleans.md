I spent last Saturday through Wednesday in New Orleans visiting my mom with my friend Anne.  We went to one Mardi Gras parade (<a href="http://www.kreweduvieux.org/Route.html" target="_blank">Krewe de Vieux</a>), one party, one jazz club, one <a href="http://www.bacchanalwine.com/#!aboutbacchanal/cpts" target="_blank">magical outdoor restaurant with live music</a>, and one seafood restaurant with char-broiled oysters, and took a trip Uptown and a trip across the lake to get Anne to her oral-history interviewees (she had work-related reason for being in New Orleans…I was just running away from home to be with my mom!).  We had delicious post-parade gumbo at Paul's house after the first of many stop-ins at <a href="http://www.caferosenicaud.com" target="_blank">Cafe Rose Nicaud</a> on Frenchmen Street. Anne & I also took the ferry across the Mississippi to Algiers and back, walked around the French Quarter, visited the Voodoo Museum, and bought a muffaletta (famous Italian sandwich of New Orleans).  Other New Orleans items we purchased: po'boys, pralines, and a red Mardi Gras mask with lace and feathers (Anne).   We did *not* patronize any drive-through daiquiri stands.

I got a lesson in New Orleans-style head-wrapping from my mom's friend Dianne, and <a href="http://b-womeninamericanhistory19.blogspot.com/2009/05/tignon-laws-in-louisiana.html" target="_blank">a history lesson</a> too!  Now when I make a big scarf or a long swath of fabric into a tignon, instead of wearing a boring old bandanna or beanie, I will know I am "quoting" the clever, rebellious free women of color of 18th-century New Orleans.

Thanks, Dianne!  (Here is one thing Dianne does…<a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=604234206290614&set=a.443064112407625.94211.328903373823700&type=1&theater" target="_blank">historic tours!</a>)

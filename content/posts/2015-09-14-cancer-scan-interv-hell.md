I had m periodic CT scans last Friday and a bone scan too, warranted by my back muscle spasms I guess, and we meet with my oncologist tomorrow afternoon to find out the results.  The Sunday after that I go to England for 8 days.  That's not very long to make a new plan if the chemo has stopped working.

Meanwhile I had vocal therapy today to work on my partially-paralyzed left vocal cord.  I'm getting better, slowly.  Tomorrow, an ENT follow-up appointment before the oncologist, and if all goes well, chemo too.

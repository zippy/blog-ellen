<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Recently a few of my closest family members and friends got together and wrote up a report card</span> for my recent course load at the University of Oncological Resistance (UOR).  It is pretty funny so I thought I would share it.:</p>
<a href="/blog/images/Ellens-report-card.docx" rel="">Ellen's report card</a>

Today is "quick" chemo (just methotrexate) and my stepsister Deb, who is visiting, is taking me.  Then we will stop by the Honest Weight food co-op in Albany to get ingredients for all the yummy things Deb is going to cook for us.  Wooo!

I am still really fatigued most of every day--I assume it's the demanding new chemo schedule.  Hard to adjust to, and I hope it's just a phase.

<div class="comment-content"><p>The report card is genius--but that&#x27;s not surprising, given the quality of the student! I really hope the daily fatigue is just a phase.</p></div>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We always figured a trial (of a PARP inhibitor) would be my next step after Eribulin but with the headache & steroids I am probably not eligible for many trials--usually steroid use indicates uncontrolled brain stuff and researchers don't want those patients in their trials.  I am tapering off the steroids but it will be a long process, if it works at all in the end.  So that's disappointing, if it turns out to be the case.  I am going to try to find out more about trials that are about breast-cancer brain-met treatment itself--I could probably get into those.  I have a brain MRI tomorrow (the last one 4 months ago showed nothing concerning, but that is a long time to hope for a weedless garden).  Then I have a consultation appointment on November 2 at Dana-Farber with a breast-cancer oncologist who has done a bunch of brain-met research (Nancy Lin).</span></p>
<p class="p1">Then there are these two new/upcoming trials, which include molecular analysis of patients' tumors and allow for treatments that target those tumors if possible: <a href="http://journals.lww.com/oncology-times/Fulltext/2015/08250/Launched__Two_of_the_Biggest_Trials_Yet_for.1.aspx?WT.mc_id=HPxADx20100319xMP" target="_blank">TAPUR and NCI-MATCH.</a>  That article is all I know about them so far.</p>

I am looking at the receipt for 20 tablets of Zofran, an anti-nausea medication that didn't work very well for me (against the nausea-inducing Adriamycin) in 1995.  That's, what, $37 per tablet?

Nothing much lately has suceeded in making me feel more sick than that $745.25.  Who takes medicine that costs that much money?  Only really, really sick people.  

Or maybe that's who runs the drug companies...

(I only had to pay $30 for them.  So lucky to have health insurance.)

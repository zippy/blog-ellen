Eric and I ran away from home a couple of days ago (leaving the kids behind) to explore a little bit of Montréal for our 10th-anniversary trip.  So we're 11 or 12 years late for our 10th anniversary...oh well. We made it at last.

And ramps.  And a minibar!

And views from the balcony to the east.

Backs of city buildings are fun to peek at.

This has been my first trip as a mobility-limited tourist.  Interesting. Hard to get over the extra attention.

Food: I wanted to do a lot of tourist eating here, but my guts complain bitterly if I overeat (which I have been doing a lot of lately). So instead I am trying to use this change of scenery and habits to learn not to overeat, to pay more attention to feelings of fullness, to order lighter food, etc.

We are about to go to Cirque de Soleil down on a quai on the river.  Mobility-impaired guests get good seats for a discount (so do their "accompagneurs") as long as they can show up 30 minutes early.  Okay!

Tomorrow we will go on a boat tour and maybe also a bus tour.

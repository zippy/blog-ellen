Today I was queasy, pretty much all day, but never so much that I was worried about throwing up.  A Zofran at 9 AM had no effect, acupuncture at 1 PM didn't seem to do much noticeable right away anyway, ginger beer and popcorn to fill my empty stomach helped a bit, the remedy from last time didn't do much, and a very strong chewy ginger candy left for me by my mom helped the most, for a little while anyway.  I'm still eating, sort of like when I had morning sickness--eating doesn't make me more queasy, maybe less--and still feeling mildly flu-like.  So this is kind of like chemically-induced stomach flu.  Hmm.  

Today I finished my application to sit for the Lamaze exam as an experienced educator with blah-di-blah hours of teaching experience and blah-di-blah contact hours of continuing education, all fully documented.  The postmark deadline is tomorrow, the exam is October 27 in Schenectady, and I have no idea how I'll feel at ALL.  Possibly just like today--kinda rotten--since that will be day 3 after chemo #3.  Perhaps worse, in which case I'll definitely defer taking the exam until April.  But it was a major milestone getting all that paperwork done for the mail tomorrow, in either case.  I feel very proud and clever that I beat the quease on that one.
